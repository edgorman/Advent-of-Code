# Advent of Code

Description taken from [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2020/about): "Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other."

My attempts are mostly completed in Python, and are prefixed with the description of the original challenge.
