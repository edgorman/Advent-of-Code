# Advent of Code

> Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.

_Description from the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/about) webpage_

This repository documents my attempts for the Advent of Code Challenges which are predominantly written in Python (C# started in 2021 solutions).

## Installation
Use the following command to clone the respository:
```
cd your/repo/directory
git clone https://github.com/edgorman/Advent-of-Code
```

## Usage
For Python solutions, make sure you have Python installed before running the command:
```
cd Day\ X
python main.py
```

For C# solutions, make sure you have the .NET desktop development package installed in Visual Studio before running a project.

If you are adding a C# project, remember to:

1. Change the "Build Action" and "Copy to Output Directory" properties for test.txt and input.txt.

For C++ solutions, make sure you have the Desktop development with C++ package installed in Visual Studio before running a project.

If you are adding a C++ project, remember to:

1. Add the "C++ Library" folder to the "Additional Include Directories" list in project properties.
2. You may need to change the file encoding of txt's from "UTF-8-BOM" to "UTF-8".
